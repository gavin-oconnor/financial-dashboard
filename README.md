# Financial Dashboad Project
After using a lot of Tableau, I am not the biggest fan.
Working on a business analytics tool that combines spreadsheet and dashboard UIs to power insights.

### Main reason for existence
It's hard to build a P&L in Tableau and hard to build a live chart with dynamic filters in Excel, why not combine the tools.

### Future Plans
Finish spreadsheet UI
Dashboard UI
Database connections
Excel-like functions across queries
Publishing dashboard features (like Tableau Server)
