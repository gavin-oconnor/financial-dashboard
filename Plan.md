### Next Features to Add

#### RIGHT NOW

FIX FORMULAS
FORMULAS

- Possibly implement pratt parsing
- Better error messages
- Understand how function evaluation works
- Cell ranges/Arrays in the formula parser
- Formula support with arrow keys

### Notes

Will need to completely change cell click logic when we allow for variable width and height rows/cols
Active cell moving off screen should trigger a change to scrollOffset
